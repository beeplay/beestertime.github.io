# Starting at the close

**Death is the secret sauce to life.** Purpose, goals, and decisions become clear once you realize your time on Earth is finite. Once acquainted with our finteness, we begin to discover infinity living in smallest of moments. It lives in-between a meeting and our lunch, becomes embodied during the stillness we steal with great effort in the early mornings, and an endorphine-filled state we chase during and after long runs. Gratitude thus becomes an acknowledgement of and an act of respect for the teacher that reaches across time to share it's wisdom.
