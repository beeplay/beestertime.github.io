In 2019, I learned to see things in a new way during a research study abroad. In a small town situated between Thailand and Myanmar called Mae Sot, I worked with the Burma Medical Association, an organization that collected the dataset for my thesis. During this time, I supported operational and knowledge sharing activities.
Surprisingly, my most meaningful insights emerged from daily, informal activities. In the evenings, I would enjoy the warmth of a steaming bowl of fish soup or lahpet thoke (fermented tea leaf salad) with my host supervisor’s family and other international students. Our conversations would shift to Myanmar’s political development, which helped me become more aware of the country’s complex history and factors affecting the present-day realities of ethnic minority groups. The nighttime silence that followed dinner, broken only by cicada calls, were times I reflected on our increasingly interconnected community and my role as a global citizen. 
Structured events provided yet another avenue to see differently. I was invited to celebrate the 30th anniversary of a primary healthcare clinic and the successes of a local art collaboration. I explored the clinic grounds and walls of colourful lines drawn by migrant pregnant women, who benefited from the proceeds of the artwork sold. In a tangible way, I saw how these community-championed initiatives played a central role in empowering the health and economic livelihood of immigrants and refugees from Myanmar.
Through these moments, I came to understand the value of global relationships. Living and learning with the community was worthwhile for reasons beyond benefits identified by researchers alone, such as improving research operations. By being willing to listen with an open mind, cultural exchanges can challenge assumptions and cultivate newfound respect and appreciation for the strengths and expertise of communities. My relationships brought into sharp focus the real lives of my research. I intend to carry this experience with me in my future work in the hopes of redefining the role of community relations in global health narratives.
