Hi! I'm an epidemiologist keen on using biostatistical methods and coding chops to prevent transmission of communicable diseases ðŸŒŽ. 

I am trained in SAS, with additional familiarity in other statistical software including Stata, R (current favourite!), and Python ðŸ‘¾. 

If you have feedback, comments, ideas, or would like to collaborate, please reach out breagh[dot]cheng[at]queensu[dot]ca ðŸ’¡
